# CSharp-Basics-Exercises

This repository contains several introductory C# programming exercises completed as part of my coursework.  
Although I am applying for an animation graduate program, these code samples demonstrate my ability to learn technical concepts, understand programming logic, and work with structured workflows.

Each exercise includes clean, well-commented C# code and can be compiled using Visual Studio or any compatible C# environment.

## Included Projects

### **1. StudentManagement**
A simple object-oriented programming exercise demonstrating:

- Class definition  
- Encapsulation (private fields + public properties)  
- Methods and formatted output  
- Object instantiation in `Main()`  

**Folder:** `StudentManagement/`  

---

### **2. DrawShapes**
A console program that outputs three shapes using asterisks (`*`):

- **Right triangle** (`draTrina`)
- **Rectangle** (`drawRec`)
- **Parallelogram** (`drawPra`)

This exercise demonstrates:

- Method design  
- Loop control  
- Nested loops for character-based graphics  

**Folder:** `DrawShapes/`

---

## How to Run

1. Open any project folder (e.g., `StudentManagement/` or `DrawShapes/`) in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.  
2. Build the project.  
3. Run the program from `Program.cs`.

## Purpose of This Repository

These code samples are included in my graduate application to show my basic programming foundation and my ability to understand structured logic and problem solving.  
Although my primary focus is 3D animation, writing clean code strengthens my understanding of pipelines, tools, and technical workflows used in animation production.
