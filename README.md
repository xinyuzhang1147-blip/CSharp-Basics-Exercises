# CSharp-Basics-Exercises

This repository contains several introductory C# programming exercises completed as part of my coursework.  
Although I am applying for a 3D animation program, these code samples demonstrate my ability to learn technical concepts, understand programming logic, and work with structured workflows.

Each exercise includes clean, well-commented C# code and can be compiled using Visual Studio or any compatible C# environment.

## Included Projects

### 1. **StudentManagement**
A simple object-oriented programming exercise demonstrating:
- Class definition
- Encapsulation (private fields + public properties)
- Methods and formatted output
- Object instantiation in `Main()`

Project files are located in **StudentManagement/**.

More exercises may be added in the future as I organize additional coursework.

## How to Run
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio (or any C# IDE).
2. Build the project.
3. Run the program via `Program.cs`.

## Purpose of This Repository
These code samples are included in my graduate application to show my basic programming foundation and my ability to understand structured logic and problem solving.
